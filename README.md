Quick Information
===================
120mm Fan Mount for a Mini Kossel 3D Printer. Works perfectly to cool prints and looks good doing it. Hides the mount points inside the fan.

This bracket mounts to the top of the bed extrusion beams and is angled to blow directly across the bed surface. It attaches near the corner brace so it won't interfere with any bed mounts in the middle of the beams. The bracket is compatible with all standard 120mm standard width fans.
